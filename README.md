# Lindenmeyer Systems by Ber2

## Description
With this piece of code you can draw Lindenmeyer Systems using pygame. This code is not intended to draw/render l-systems in real time in your game. I strongly suggest using this tool to get a image file to use it later in your game since this project is not optimized.

You can save or load systems with json files and export the drawn lsystems.

## TODO's
- Working GUI for importing, exporting, creating lsystems and such.
- Cleanup and optimizing for better performance.
- Better export options such as .GIF

    He has very well documented explanations about some freaky math-physics
    stuff, really inspired and informed me with his articles
